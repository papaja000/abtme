      <h3>what am I currently doing?</h3>
      <p>currently I'm working on making my own operating system (don't let the website's look scare you)</p>
      <p>it'll be based on Arch Linux and will target minimal hardware</p>
      <p class="shhh">not to brag or anything but 1G RAM usage on idle is pretty neat...</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>ABOUT THE OPERATING SYSTEM:</h3>
      <p>it'll be an arch linux based distribution, with Hyprland as the Window Manager.</p>

      <hr>
      <h4>when will I release the os?</h4>
      <p>definitely not any time soon. It's a hobby project being made in my free time so you should NOT expect to see it any time soon.</p>
